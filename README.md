# 2021-CT619---Object-Oriented-Programming
MCT619, Object-Oriented Programming, provides detailed coverage of Object-Oriented (OO) programming principles. It focuses on programming in Java, an OO language that is modern, vendor-independent, and widely used in industry.

Recognising that programming requires skill as well as knowledge, this module places
emphasis on the practical aspects of developing significant Java programs using a
professional development environment. Students also gain practical experience of
program design, testing, and debugging.

Specifically in this module, students learn how to model objects in software, define
classes describing categories of objects, and make appropriate use of concepts such as
inheritance, composition, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstract classes, and
interfaces. As well as learning basic Java syntax and how to express OO concepts in
Java, practical topics such as applets, graphics, data storage, multi-threaded
programming, and exception handling are addressed.


**1.2 Prerequisites**
--

Students must have a good working knowledge of a procedural programming language
such as C, to the standard attained through successful completion of MCT612
Application Programming.

**1.3 Module Objectives**
--

At the end of the module, students are expected to be able to competently:

> Describe in detail Object-Oriented Programming concepts (e.g.
classes, inheritance, composition, modularity, polymorphism)
> Analyse and interpret complex Object-Oriented programs
written in Java
> Develop Object-Oriented solutions to programming problems,
implement them in Java, test and debug them
> Write code to demonstrate knowledge of array structures,
files, applets, graphical programs, multi-threaded programming,
and exceptions
> Evaluate and justify decisions made in programs (e.g. selection
of data types, choice of decision and repetition structures, use of
inheritance or composition)
